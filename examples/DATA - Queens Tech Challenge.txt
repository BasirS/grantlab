As they progress, users earn “gemstones” that can be exchanged for prizes, workshops, and services provided by our corporate and global partners and volunteers. The platform also provides access to mentorship programs, job opportunities, and other resources, making it a gateway to a broader ecosystem of support for participants. Feedback is actively gathered before, during, and after programming through various methods, including interviews, observations, and participatory design sessions with community members, students, educators, and other stakeholders. This comprehensive feedback mechanism allows Cambio Labs to refine and customize its curricula and the Journey platform, ensuring our programs are aligned with and responsive to the users' and community needs.What's your unique value proposition? What is your secret sauce? Including product or service distinct features and benefits that will convince your customers to use your product/service (800 max)Cambio Labs distinguishes itself by prioritizing empowerment of BIPOC communities through innovative, technology-driven learning experiences. Cambio offers work-based learning opportunities at no cost to participants, specifically for low-income youth and adults to become founders of social businesses. We develop cross-sectoral partnerships to create paid learning and mentorship opportunities that include training in green tech through a gamified digital platform we designed. By integrating tools like no-code prototyping, design thinking, and introducing AI and blockchain, Cambio equips participants to leverage technology for social change. Our curriculum, co-created with the community and tailored to each cohort's needs, aims to be scalable to tackle systemic barriers head-on. Why are you uniquely qualified to build this business? What are your domain expertise, life experience, passion that led you to start this business? 1000Sebastián Martín, the founder of Cambio Labs, grew up observing the challenges his Latinx immigrant parents faced as entrepreneurs, which inspired him to address the systemic barriers within the education and entrepreneurship ecosystems for communities of color.  Launching his first social venture in 2013, Sebastián adopted a direct trade model to empower local indigenous cooperatives in Bolivia by exporting and retailing their coffee in Shanghai, ensuring farmers retained a greater share of profits. This experience, combined with the realization of the limited resources, mentorship, and support available for entrepreneurs of color, led him to teach social and green entrepreneurship. Recognizing the piecemeal and inequitable delivery of social entrepreneurship education for BIPOC youth, he founded Cambio Labs in 2021, which has served over 380 participants.  We aim to create access to entrepreneurial education, employment opportunities & generational wealth.Who have you identified as your existing and potential competitors? How do you plan to manage the competition? 1000Cambio Labs has identified several organizations as its competitors, including LearnServe International in Washington, DC, Project Invent in San Francisco, CA, and Uncharted Learning in Illinois, each offering educational programs with overlaps in social entrepreneurship and technology. Cambio Labs sets itself apart through its dedicated focus on low-income BIPOC students and offering programs free of charge or as paid internships, contrasting with its competitors who charge for participation.  Cambio Labs does not serve private schools, emphasizing inclusivity and access. We are able to do so through partnerships with education agencies and nonprofits who share the mission of equitable education and empowered workforces. Our plan is to stay focused on creating engaging and responsive curricula and technology, and deepening our strategic partnerships with mission-oriented, cross-sectoral partners. What are (or will be) your biggest drivers of revenue?

Our revenue has doubled in the last two years, and we estimate a growth rate of 18-20% annually, conservatively as our track record continues to deliver value for a greater diversity of partners who aim to diversify the entrepreneurship ecosystem to include historically marginalized and underestimated communities in the public, nonprofit, and private sector.Who are your target customers and how your product/service is currently sold/distributed? Cambio Labs target customers are organizations that serve to empower participants from underestimated BIPOC communities with entrepreneurship and workforce skills development.

Internally, we will be able to employ three full-time teammates this year. Each of us is doing work in several capacities, like many startups! With limited resources, we have really flexed our creativity, resourcefulness, and strength through our community partnerships. Financially, we have validated our concept through the doubling of our partnerships and income.  85% of our income is from sales revenue. Through it all, we are only increasing our ability to make entrepreneurship education more accessible.Our short-term goals include increasing our capacity to deliver green workforce development programming for all ages that create generational wealth, especially at NYCHA, where we know there is tremendous entrepreneurial potential and talent.  Longterm, we hope to launch a nation-wide train-the-trainer program so that entrepreneurship education is truly accessible, starting in high school everywhere.
