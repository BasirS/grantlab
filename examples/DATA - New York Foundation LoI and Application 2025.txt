Narrative*This portion of the application helps us to learn more about your organization’s work and how you align with our criteria and priorities, which we encourage you to carefully review. We are specifically looking for how you are engaging in community organizing and/or grassroots advocacy and whether your organization is led by people who have been historically marginalized. Community organizing: Community-initiated and -led mobilization that builds power for progressive social and systemic change.Organizing groups are accountable to their community and help to hold public officials accountable. Organizing strives to create the conditions that allow people to choose how to live their lives with dignity and with the support and resources to thrive.Grassroots advocacy: A strategy carried out by those directly affected that rallies public action to create equitable policies.Answer the following questions in 10,000 characters or lessOur organization's mission and historyCambio Labs empowers low income BIPOC social entrepreneurs and workers through educational programs, learning technology, and by providing access to investment and job opportunities.Cambio Labs was founded in 2021 by Sebastián Martín, a social entrepreneur driven by a deep commitment to addressing systemic inequities in education and opportunity. After witnessing firsthand the lack of access to entrepreneurial education and mentorship for BIPOC youth while working as an educator, Sebastián was inspired to take action and founding Cambio Labs.Since its inception, Cambio Labs has developed transformative educational programs and technology, such as our digital learning platform 'Journey' and green and entrepreneurial workforce development initiatives.Through user-centered design and continuous collaboration with the communities we serve, we've supported over 500 participants to date, helping them develop critical skills in innovation, leadership, and problem-solving.In this vein, we have created Cambio Solar, our green workforce development program to create access to clean energy jobs, utilities savings through community solar projects, and green cooperative and business ownership for NYC’s most economically and environmentally vulnerable community members.The community we work with and forCambio Solar primarily serves low-income BIPOC residents of NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) starting at Mott Haven Houses, with plans to expand throughout the Bronx and eventually all NYCHA developments. Located in the South Bronx—home to some of the most economically challenged Congressional districts in the country—public housing residents frequently endure widespread economic disparities, with average annual incomes of around $27,000.Residents face numerous barriers, including high unemployment rates, limited educational attainment, and chronic health issues (e.g., asthma), often exacerbated by poor living conditions and persistent environmental pollutants. Moreover, a lack of viable access to stable, high-paying jobs—especially in industries with upward mobility—continues to hinder long-term economic progress.Despite these obstacles, the entrepreneurial potential within South Bronx public housing remains largely untapped. Less than 1% of area NYCHA residents report income from business activities, due to systemic challenges such as minimal access to capital, formal business training, and professional networks. Cambio Solar strives to fill these gaps by equipping NYCHA residents with the industry-specific skills, certifications, and partnerships needed to pursue clean energy jobs—or even to establish their own solar businesses and cooperatives.Cambio Solar and Community Organizing Participatory Program DevelopmentAt Cambio Solar, NYCHA residents aren’t just program participants – they’re co-designers of our programs. Our program designing begins with co-hosting a series of ecosystem building workshops with tenant leaders; this year at 10 NYCHA community centers that will bring together a coalition of nonprofits, government agencies and financial institutions to rising resident solar entrepreneurs.We begin every initiative with listening sessions and hands-on workshops, where residents voice their needs and ideas.  For example, at our Mott Haven Houses workshop, parents, youth, and elders gathered to express interests in solutions for high electricity bills and scarce employment opportunities.. Residents like Maria, a local tenant leader, shared personal stories about struggling with utility costs and her dream of seeing local youth in solar jobs. These stories and ideas directly shaped the program’s design – from the topics in our solar training curriculum to the schedule of classes. By engaging the community at the planning stage, we build strong community engagement and buy-in. Neighbors see their input reflected in the project, fostering trust and enthusiasm. This participatory approach ensures our programs address real-world challenges the community faces, making the impact immediate and tangible. It also lays a foundation for long-term sustainability, as the community feels ownership of solutions they helped create.Training and Leadership DevelopmentCambio Solar’s training program is designed not only to teach technical skills but also to cultivate community leaders. Each participant receives comprehensive education in solar installation, green entrepreneurship, and cooperative business models. Mentorship is a key component – trainees work side by side with experienced solar installers and community organizers who coach them through both technical tasks and community outreach. Prudencia,, a resident who joined our first cohort of Startup NYCHA in Fulton Houses, was initially shy about public speaking and was learning English- but through practicing with a coach, she gained the confidence to pitch in front of seed investors and approached potential customers in the street. Similarly, in our youth programs, our Comp Sci High graduates in the South Bronx became peer mentors to future cohorts.  Many participants follow a similar path – they start as learners and graduate as local leaders. We encourage graduates to become mentors for the next cohort or organizers of new solar projects, creating a cycle of leadership development. Our vision for Cambio Solar is to develop community-trained leaders who can form and run their own worker-owned solar cooperative, ensuring the program’s benefits ripple outward. By building skills and leadership capacity, we empower residents to take charge of clean energy projects in their neighborhood. This focus on leadership development means the community will have its own champions for environmental justice and renewable energy long after the initial training ends.Ecosystem Building through Local Partnerships & Cross-Sector CollaborationsOur grassroots organizing is strengthened by a broad network of local partnerships across sectors. Too long, supporters and advocates for green and solar innovation and employment for NYCHA residents have been operating in silos. Cambio Solar works hand-in-hand with public agencies, nonprofits, schools, and businesses to consolidate resources and expertise for NYCHA residents. Partners in this ecosystem include: city and local government agencies, like SBS and NYCHA REES that are supporting our NYCHA entrepreneurship programs, nonprofits like the Oyate Group and the RETI Center that have collaborated with us to deliver entrepreneurial and green workforce programs, educational partners like CUNY and local schools like the Lab School of Finance and technology that have worked with us to provide internships opportunities to local young people, and resident and citizen groups like the Mott Haven Tenement Association leadership that have offered their local community center to organize workshops and have helped us connect with the burrough’s most vulnerable residents of public housing. We are also building inroads and collaborations with local green employers in the city like Brooklyn Solar works, unions like IBEW, and elected officials like Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigalthat have recognized our work.Our funders for our pilot of Cambio Solar at Mott Haven Houses in the Bronx include WorldConnect, the Urban Justice Center, and the High Wind Impact Fund, and our hope is to launch Cambio Solar in NYCHA developments across the city to create accessible green infrastructure, and to activate publicly accessible spaces for community members to benefit from free renewable energy job training, green entrepreneurship accelerator programs, internship and job placement opportunities, and access to mentorship, technology, and mutual aid.Economic Empowerment Ultimately, Cambio Solar’s community organizing drives toward economic empowerment and lasting policy change. Our approach helps families save money and gain income in the long run, breaking cycles of poverty. As participants complete training, they can secure well-paying jobs in the booming clean energy sector or even launch their own green businesses. Graduates have the opportunity to form a worker-owned solar cooperative installer business, meaning they become co-owners rather than just employees. This model leads to long-term financial independence: profits and savings stay within the community instead of going to outside companies.Through our comprehensive curriculum, participants develop entrepreneurial and technological skills to address issues they care about, designing impactful solutions and learning to effectively advocate for the changes they envision.Issue Area*The New York Foundation funds across many issues.
