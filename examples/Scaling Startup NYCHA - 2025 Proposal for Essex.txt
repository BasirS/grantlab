Scaling Startup NYCHA - 2025 Proposal1. Organizational HistoryCambio Labs is a nonprofit that helps low-income youth and adults build businesses, careers, and financial independence. We offer hands-on entrepreneurship programs, job training, and access to our gamified learning platform, Journey. Our programs teach real-world skills—like how to start a mission-driven business, land a job in tech, or launch a community project. We partner with schools, nonprofits, and employers to give participants the tools, support, and networks they need to grow income, create jobs, and build generational wealth.Founded in 2021, Cambio Labs was created to reimagine what economic development looks like when led by and for the communities most impacted by inequality. We started small and have since grown internationally.2. Our ProgramsCambio exists to confront and dismantle systemic barriers—economic exclusion, digital inequity, and environmental injustice—by equipping underestimated New Yorkers to become agents of change in their own communities. Our integrated suite of programs is designed to cultivate entrepreneurial leadership, workforce readiness, and cooperative power, especially in low-income public housing developments. Each program ladders up to our central belief: when people gain access to tools, training, and community, they generate the solutions their neighborhoods need most.Entrepreneurship as Community Power  We believe entrepreneurship is more than a business path—it’s a tool for reclaiming agency and reshaping local economies.? Social Entrepreneurship Incubator for Youth: Our 12-week flagship program introduces middle and high school students to social entrepreneurship through hands-on learning in design thinking, business modeling, and storytelling. Participants identify local challenges and prototype solutions, culminating in a public pitch competition with seed funding for their ventures.? StartUp NYCHA: Co-designed with NYCHA residents and tenant leaders, this 6-month business accelerator supports public housing residents—especially women of color—in launching income-generating ventures. Participants receive business training, mentorship, and microgrant funding, while building lasting community connections. Following a successful pilot in 2024, we aim to launch a second cohort and build a citywide movement for economic self-determination.Technology as a Pathway to Equity: In the face of widening digital divides, we equip learners with the technical and critical thinking skills needed to thrive—and lead—in the modern digital economy.  ? Cambio Coding & AI: this program introduces youth and adult learners to AI tools and programming languages like Python, HTML, and C++ while emphasizing real-world applications for social change. Participants learn to harness technology not only for personal and career advancement, but also to close digital access gaps in their own communities.Climate Resilience as Economic Opportunity Environmental degradation hits low-income communities hardest. We respond with pathways that create green jobs, build energy resources and cooperative wealth, and advance environmental justice.? Cambio Solar: This workforce and entrepreneurship program prepares NYCHA residents for careers in renewable energy,  green construction and infrastructure, and solar installation. Participants earn industry certifications, receive mentorship from jobs green employer partners. Participants are also introduced to our entrepreneurship curriculum, to develop  green business and cooperative ideas. The Backbone: Journey, Our Digital Learning Platform:  All of Cambio’s programs are unified by Journey, our gamified and AI-assisted digital platform that ensures equitable access to high-quality content, peer connection, and skill-building at scale. Journey makes it possible for learners to move at their own pace, revisit materials, and remain connected to their cohort and mentors long after a program ends— creating lasting pathways to digital, educational, and economic empowerment for our learners.3. Startup NYCHA Program OverviewStartup NYCHA is a six-month business accelerator that equips NYCHA residents with the training, coaching, and capital to launch ventures and generate community wealth.Piloted in 2024, the program supported 23 resident entrepreneurs in building food businesses, fashion brands, and social ventures addressing local issues like mental health and youth access to sports. Participants receive weekly in-person and hybrid instruction, milestone-based seed funding, and 24/7 access to our AI-enabled Journey platform. Each cohort anchors a Saturday “Cambio Space” at a trusted community site—creating a consistent hub for business development, coaching, and wraparound support.Startup NYCHA earned a New York State Senate Proclamation in its first year, and demand has surged: over 270 residents joined our 2025 workshops, and four community partners— Hudson Guild, Vision Urbana, Queens, Community House, and Mott Haven Houses—have requested year-round programming. With support from the Essex Avenue Foundation, we are ready to meet that demand and expand Startup NYCHA into a citywide movement.4. Target AudienceFor thousands of New Yorkers living in public housing, entrepreneurship is one of the few viable paths to income and ownership. Yet fewer than 1 percent of NYCHA residents currently report business revenue, stifled by limited capital, scarce mentorship, and systemic barriers that keep household incomes near $27,000.? Startup NYCHA serves NYCHA resident entrepreneurs, who are predominantly women of color. Based on our pilot data and 2025 sign-ups, the average participant has a household income under $30,000, is unemployed or underemployed, and often lacks formal business training. Participants face barriers such as digital exclusion, limited access to capital, and systemic disinvestment.More than 80% of 2024 participants reported they would not have pursued their venture without this program. By embedding our accelerator in trusted community spaces, employing NYCHA alumni as instructors, and by providing access to tech and coaching, we create a culturally responsive, high-impact accelerator and community space where entrepreneurs can develop their early stage businesses.5. Program ActivitiesEach Startup NYCHA cohort includes:? Weekly Saturday sessions (in-person and hybrid) covering entrepreneurship, branding, financial literacy, and pitching.? Startup Accelerator curriculum delivered via our Journey platform and weekly in-person facilitation.? Prizes & seed funding incentives based on completion of program and Gems in your Journey wallet!? One-on-one coaching, with access to mentors, and peer learning opportunities.? A Final Pitch event with community panels and cash prizes.? Lifetime access to our digital platform and ongoing support through the alumni network.? Wrap around services, including inviting community partners, such as Gotham Food Pantry and Vols Pro Bono Lawyers to provide free meals, legal clinics, and workforce workshops.? An expanded ecosystem with new location partnersEach cohort serves 20–30 NYCHA residents and is hosted by a community partner site (e.g. Hudson Guild, Mott Haven Houses). These sites are also the first Cambio Spaces – community-activated hubs that provide access to workshops, tech, food, and a variety of volunteer and mutual aid-led services. 6. Proposal & Budget Request– Scaling Startup NYCHAWe propose scaling Startup NYCHA to four cohorts between September 2025–March 2026, with 20–30 participants each. We are requesting up to $200,000 ($45,915 per cohort) from the Essex Avenue Foundation to fully fund one to four cohorts at local community centers  (Review breakdown of $45,915 cohort cost here).Anticipated Outcomes per CohortEach of the x4 proposed Startup NYCHA cohorts will produce:? 25 fully developed business plans? 10 pitch-ready ventures ? 3 pitch-winning entrepreneurs that receive startup capital? Measured improvements in employability skills development, educational module completion, new business establishment, certifications received, mentorship and coaching engagements, job placements, and investments or stipends received as a result of accelerator programming 7. Staffing PlanStartup NYCHA program design and management will be led by: Sebastián Martín, Founder & CEO, Project Lead; Michelle Maluwetig, Director of Operations; Richard Dacalos, Curricular & Journey Lead; Veronica Olivares, Outreach Specialist; Angelo Orciuoli, Data & Evaluation Specialist; and a locally recruited Startup NYCHA Instructor, preferably an alumni or from target community.Each Startup NYCHA site will have a dedicated Cohort Team, including: 1 Instructor & facilitator per cohort, and 4-5 volunteer Mentors and Coaches per cohort (sourced from local entrepreneur and NYCHA alumni networks). We will also strive to engage and create work opportunities for NYCHA resident youth, interns, assistant teachers, and volunteers recruited from the local community to help operate and activate the Cambio Spaces weekly services and programming.Startup NYCHA will continue engaging and including resident co-leaders. We will also continue to include Tenant Association Presidents from the NYCHA housing communities we work with.8. Budget Request (full breakdown of $45,915 cohort cost here)Instruction, Curriculum, & Program Administration ($26,290): This covers direct program delivery by an expert lead instructor, personalized one-on-one business coaching, and continual updates to our curriculum to reflect resident feedback and evolving market realities. This covers the updating and customization of our core entrepreneurship curriculum to each NYCHA cohort. While the majority of curriculum development costs are front-loaded (i.e., incurred during initial build), we include modest ongoing costs per cohort to allow for community co-design, integration of updated public resources, and inclusion of resident feedback. These costs are expected to decrease over time, but remain necessary to keep materials locally relevant and resident-informed. Funds also support behind-the-scenes infrastructure: from recruitment and onboarding to HR, reporting, and alumni communications. Each role is filled by mission-aligned professionals committed to building trust, consistency, and community ownership over time.Digital Platform Access & Evaluation ($6,425):  Our AI-enabled learning platform, Journey, is the connective tissue of the program—tracking progress, hosting curriculum, and supporting asynchronous learning and coaching. This includes a lifetime license for participants and staff, live support, and a data science fellow to track outcomes and improve cohort strategy based on real-time feedback.Outreach & Community Engagement ($4,300): Targeted digital campaigns, and one-on-one follow-up to ensure NYCHA residents hear about, apply to, and feel a sense of belonging in the program. This approach directly supports our goal of building a pipeline of overlooked but high-potential founders.Program Delivery Materials ($1,900): This includes essential tools like Airtable, Notion, and Canva Pro, plus workshop supplies. We also include small, gamified milestone prizes on our digital platform.Travel & Transportation ($500): This ensures that guests and mentors can attend in-person pitch events and workshops by covering public transit costs and local travel stipends. Food & Hospitality ($1,500): We create a warm, celebratory environment during milestone moments—like our speed coaching night and final pitch day reception—by providing meals for participants, families, and community members. Seed Funding & Venture Prizes ($5,000):Increases motivation and makes an incredible impact for our entrepreneurs to continue developing their businesses. 9. Organizational Capability & Project SustainabilityThis request is backed by a track record of sustainable growth and responsible financial management. Cambio Labs has grown from just $2,819 in total income in 2021 to a projected $398,873 in 2024, representing more than a 14,000% increase in four years. This growth reflects intentional strategy, diversified funding streams, and effective program delivery across both youth and adult audiences.Our monthly burn rate was approximately $18,000–$25,000 in the past year, with over 90% of expenditures dedicated to programmatic costs and technology infrastructure. We operate with a lean full-time team (2 full-time staff, 3 part-time staff, and 1 part-time developer), while leveraging a strong volunteer network (15+ active volunteers) and dozens of subsidized interns from partners like Company Ventures, America on Tech, First Tech Fund, CUNY Stem and Green, and Grant Associates.We maintain robust internal systems, including reconciled QuickBooks accounts, and Notion for all documentation and record keeping, enabling full transparency and compliance for restricted funds. This infrastructure allows us to scale impact without sacrificing fiscal discipline.As school budgets tighten nationally, Cambio Labs is proactively transitioning toward adult workforce development, technology licensing (PaaP), and scalable community-based models like Startup NYCHA and Cambio Solar. The Essex Avenue Foundation’s support would not only fully fund one NYCHA cohort in 2025-26—it would also contribute to the long-term sustainability and equity-driven growth of a tech-first nonprofit innovating at the intersection of education, entrepreneurship, and community transformation.10. Organization Budget & 2025 Financial OutlookOur revenue model is intentionally diversified. For 2025, we project:? 60% from earned income via educational partnerships, school contracts, and workforce programs? 20% from philanthropic grants (private foundations, accelerators, and government agencies)? 20% from corporate sponsorships and discretionary supportHistorical Budgetary Overview:? FY 2023 Total Budget: $211,428? FY 2024 Projected Budget: $398,873+? FY 2025 Projected Budget: $450,000–$600,000Projected 2025 Income: $390,600 See Sources of SupportWe anticipate continued growth in earned revenue through platform licensing, as more partners adopt our Journey 2.0 PaaP model to power their entrepreneurship and workforce education programs.11. Concluding NotesStartup NYCHA directly addresses economic inequality, supports entrepreneurial aspirations among NYCHA residents, and helps build a more equitable and vibrant NYC. With your support, we will continue to scale a model that transforms untapped potential into community-powered prosperity. We are grateful for your consideration.Appendix A: Related Resources1.
