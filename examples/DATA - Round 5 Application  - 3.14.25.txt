We create transformative educational programs and technology to equip founders, students, and workers with the skills and networks to uplift their businesses and communities. Our mission is to build a more equitable and sustainable future by empowering and upskilling the next generation of purpose-driven leaders.Q18 Tell us a brief history about your organization. Cambio Labs was established in 2021 by Sebastián Martín, a social entrepreneur and educator, in response to educational and employment inequities faced by low-income BIPOC youth in New York City.  Recognizing the urgent need for financial, digital,  and self-advocacy training among the city's most creative yet underserved youth, Sebastián and 2 coders in high school launched the first version of the Journey Platform, introducing essential social entrepreneurship training on a gamified online learning platform they designed. The platform has been piloted across 22 hybrid programs now, and now also supports  green workforce development programs in solar panel installation and EV infrastructure. With its first expansion into NY Public Schools in 2024 and programs in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, Cambio Labs has equipped over 380 individuals with vital skills in social, environmental innovation, and digital financial literacy.Q19 If your organization is on the web, please list any links (e.g., website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter): ?

Youtube: https://www.www.youtube.com/@cambiolabs1414 Q20 What services (programs, projects) does your organization currently provide? Cambio Labs provides educational technology and curricular programs that transform community members into social entrepreneurs, designers for impact, and community activists. Cambio Labs has four primary learning solutions, all of which are designed in collaboration with community partners and beneficiaries.Programs:(i)  The gamified digital learning platform, Journey:Journey represents the cutting edge of dynamic online learning, while still being rooted in the best practices for project-based and experiential learning. On Journey, participants engage with multimedia lessons, complete prompts, and complete team-based challenges as they launch their ventures. Users of Journey are rewarded with “gemstones”, which they are able to accumulate and cash in for prizes like workshops and services that are provided by our corporate and global partners and volunteers.  These workshops are geared towards catalyzing the ventures of participants, and creating a sense of community and connection.The Journey platform acts as a gateway to a broader ecosystem of partner support, providing access to economic and job opportunities, mentorship programs, and other resources. Our technology platform represents a scalable solution for automating and standardizing our entrepreneurial curriculum, while providing instructors easy- to-use teaching tools and guides. Journey will be a critical tool in enabling us to run programs across multiple NYCHA communities.(ii) Startup NYCHA: Our Startup NYCHA program offers cohort-based training, access to our gamified learning platform (Journey), business development services, and mentorship so that NYCHA residents can acquire the knowledge and resources to launch their own companies or cooperatives, secure internship and employment opportunities, and launch community-based projects that address local social and environmental challenges.With the support of WSCF, we have launched a six-month pilot program from April 6 - October 15, 2024. At the end of our accelerator program, entrepreneurs will have an opportunity to pitch their companies to a panel of investors and judges for a chance to earn further business support, in-kind services, and grants to continue piloting their businesses.(iii) The Social Entrepreneurship Incubator is designed for social entrepreneurs and teachers, by teachers with actual social entrepreneurship experience. Cambio Labs has created a robust curriculum with durable employment and entrepreneurship skill-building, supported by a diverse ecosystem of support for new social entrepreneurs to thrive. This ecosystem is built by connecting students with leaders and mentors in the tech, sustainability, and entrepreneurship fields through a platform that can catalyze their careers and future ventures.Cambio Labs' signature Social Entrepreneurship Program creates a learning experience tailored to different types of learners. Our program invites feedback and self-assessment from participants and program partners after each session. Students who graduate from the program have the opportunity to become co-facilitators, alumni mentors, and paid Cambio Labs interns. (iv) The Green Workforce Development Program curriculum is co-designed with multiple community-based organizations and supported by government and corporate partners. In 2022, we collaborated with the RETI Center in Red Hook, Brooklyn to deliver the Roof RETI Solar Installation Training Program, a solar workforce development collaboration supported by Amazon and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSDERA). Adult program participants are able to use the Journey platform to complete the course, and after course completion, they are connected to paid internships opportunities through Good Shepherd Services (GSS), attain OSHA 40 Certification and GPRO Certification through the Green Urban Council, and visit real solar work sites through our partnership with Brooklyn SolarWorks. Last but not least, our program participants obtain a Green Social Entrepreneurship Certification from Cambio Labs.  If your organization is new, what services do you plan to provide? N/AWhat are 2 accomplishments your organization has achieved in the past 5 years? Here are two accomplishments we’d like to share with you.1) With the support of the West Side Community Fund, we were able to launch our StartUp NYCHA pilot at Fulton Houses and Chelsea Elliot Houses. StartUp NYCHA is a six-month entrepreneurial accelerator designed for NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) residents, providing business development support, mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to the Journey platform. During the program, entrepreneurs define their product, customers, business model, sales strategy, funding strategy, and actually pilot and test their products with real users and customers. The program culminates in a pitching competition, where NYCHA resident entrepreneurs pitch their business for rewards and further business development opportunities.In the pilot at Fulton Houses, over 60 residents signed up, with 30 entrepreneurs selected for the first cohort—95% of whom were women of color. Participants received business training, mentorship, and have thus far prototyped and tested their products and business services.  The overwhelming response and waitlist for Startup NYCHA indicated a strong desire among NYCHA residents for entrepreneurship education.  Due to the success of our pilot, leadership at the Mott Haven Tenement Association have reached out to design and launch Startup NYCHA in the Bronx, with a focus on green entrepreneurship.  2) Second, we were able to launch the Journey Platform, a gamified learning learning platform that blends best practices for online and in-person learning, and offers a supportive ecosystem by connecting students with leaders and mentors in the tech, sustainability, and entrepreneurship field through a platform that can catalyze their careers and future ventures. This was a major accomplishment that took lots of prototyping, coding, and user testing to create. We have launched over 30 distinct programs through the platform, and are proud to integrate content and functionalities that equip participants with the ability to leverage AI and no-code prototyping to optimize their businesses.   How many unduplicated participants has your organization served from July 1, 2023 to date? Expected 380Served 523Of your participant pool, how many are (or will be) residents in the Chelsea/Hudson Yards/Hell's Kitchen areas (Community Board 4)?23Has your organization received a grant from West Side Community Fund in the past?   o	Yes, we received the grant in the past What year(s) did you receive the grant in the past? (check all that apply)x	2023   Section 3: Information about your Proposed Program/ProjectPlease note that these questions relate to the specific program or project for which you are submitting this application, and not to your organization as a whole. What is the name of your proposed program/project?StartUp NYCHAWhat type of grant are you applying for?o	Large grant of over $5,000  What is the total amount you are requesting? $10,000Please identify whether this program/project serves a specific population. (check all that apply)?	Immigrants/New New Yorkers ?	Low-Income  ?	NYCHA Residents  ?	Youth  ?	BIPOC  What is the need you are addressing through this program/project? How did you identify that this need exists? Cambio Labs is on a mission to disrupt the education system and tackle the systemic exclusion of low-income and BIPOC students from wealth creation opportunities by equipping them with the skills, networks, and tools to succeed in the current economy. We have validated this need through extensive research about the problem, and through the real world promotion and execution of our programs. Each year, 1.2 million high school students in the US drop out of school, and 1 in 3 BIPOC students attend schools that graduate less than 60% of their students, known as "dropout factories." By pairing students with mentors and coaches from the BIPOC community, Cambio Labs provides culturally-informed support beyond the traditional high school infrastructure by acknowledging the angst students feel about systemic issues and channeling it into the creation of business solutions that are empowering. We have now served over 150 students and have received positive survey feedback, testimonials, and data that confirms that students felt like Cambio Labs programs filled a gap in their education, and that they felt better equipped to pursue jobs and acquire wealth.Schools are failing to teach durable skills to succeed in the job market, such as problem-solving, leadership, communication, critical thinking, teamwork, adaptability, and creativity. A review of 82 million job postings in 2021 found that 70% of requested skills were durable skills, and that 69% of businesses reported difficulty hiring qualified talent. This was confirmed through our own experience by the fact that our students had struggled to find paid internship and job opportunities. To ensure that under-resourced students thrive upon graduating, Cambio Labs connects students to valuable social networks among mentors and employers, and strives to place them in paid internship opportunities.A report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Black and Latinx children are less likely to move up the income ladder than their white peers, even when accounting for income. Cambio Labs seeks to address this lack of upward mobility by connecting program participants with immediate paid internship opportunities and connecting them throughout the program with a wide network of entrepreneurs who contribute their services, knowledge and support as part of our digital learning platform.  A recession hits the most vulnerable hardest, especially when it comes to employment.  Already, unemployment rates in public housing developments in New York City are three times higher than the citywide average, with 20% of residents being unemployed compared to 7% in the city as a whole. The median income for households in public housing developments in New York City is $24,000 per year, compared to the citywide median income of $71,000 per year (Source: The Furman Center).  According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the rate of business creation in lower-income areas is significantly lower than the rest of NYC. Providing support for business creation and strengthening durable skills is one way that residents can create employment and wealth for their communities.Residents of public housing developments in New York City have a significantly lower level of educational attainment, with only 51% of adults having a high school diploma compared to 86% in the city as a whole (Source: The Furman Center). The need for culturally competent education, designed for and by the community that provides immediate access to employment, apprenticeship and certifications is paramount to addressing the systemic inequity in our public education.We validated these needs in the Chelsea area by speaking with Fulton residents, community leaders like Miguel Acevedo, by reading reports like the District Needs Statement released by Community Board 4, and most importantly, by recruiting NYCHA resident entrepreneurs to our program that have expressed interest in engaging in a six-month cohort experience.Provide a summary of the proposed program or project (250-500). Our project is called Startup NYCHA, an initiative to bring entrepreneurship programs and business development resources to NYCHA complexes across New York City. The objective of our program is to create access to entrepreneurial education and resources so that NYCHA residents can launch their own companies, gain access to employment and internship opportunities, and launch community-based projects that can also solve local social and environmental problems.Currently the entrepreneurs have prototyped, and are preparing for their final pitch in one month! Results of this pilot program will include:? 25 entrepreneurs will graduate and develop competencies that can help them gain employment or launch their own businesses? Participants build social capital as they are coached and mentored by professionals in the fields of finance, entrepreneurship, technology, and more? Connecting program graduates to paid internship opportunities, and to follow-up grants and business development opportunities provided by organizations like NYC Boss Up, REES, and the SBS.? Training and employment of a NYCHA resident to become the ongoing instructor of our programs? Funding and in-kind services that will be awarded to the best startup initiatives? All program participants will also have access to our Journey platform and alumni community, where they can benefit from entrepreneurial curriculum, resources, career opportunities, and prizes for the rest of their lives.NYCHA residents that live in Section 9 housing can also qualify for federal grants as entrepreneurs, as well as preferential contracts for serving and refurbishing and repairing NYCHA. We want to pilot our program at Fulton Houses and Chelsea-Elliot Houses in Chelsea, but ultimately our goal is to bring entrepreneurship programs and incubator spaces to NYCHA developments all over the city. Through our robust and standardized learning platform, and an interconnected network of community projects and instructors, we want to build the infrastructure for a social  innovation ecosystem entrepreneurial movement across NYCHA and beyond.How many unduplicated (i.e., unique) participants do you expect to serve through the proposed program/project? 30What percentage of the participants in your proposed program/project will fall in each age bracket? 19 to 25  20%	26 to 40  	50%41 to 59  	30%	 	How will you conduct outreach to the target population? We meet every week with our entrepreneurs, and organize pop up markets and speed coaching events apart from our 2.5 hour in-person weekly sessions.  We also use  our signature Journey platform and Slack to communicate asynchronously with entrepreneurs.We have conducted extensive outreach in co-designing our pilot:? We have presented at Tenement Association Meetings and attended 4 NYCHA Community Events. Throughout the summer we received 60+ Sign Ups for Startup NYCHA, expressing interest in the program. Intergenerational demand with ~ 20 youth and ~40 adults signed up.? We have received community support from residents, tenement leaders, and REES. We have received funding from the West Side Community Fund and verbal support about funding and resources from the Department of Strategy and Innovation at NYCHA to help kick off this initiative.? We conducted community sign up events and recruited the first cohort summer of 2023, and ran the first workshop in November 2023. ? We held our first Startup NYCHA workshop to co-design with interested participants, and it was well attended by 11 adults who have all committed to becoming part of our first cohort!? We surveyed all participants and received very high ratings on the workshop and interest in a full fledged 8 week program, with a 9.4 NPS score.? We are in communication with interested participants by email and on our Slack channelHow will you measure the success of your proposed program/project? Please state 2 key objectives and corresponding projected goals you aim to achieve. Include any metrics to evaluate your program (e.g., number of unduplicated people the project will serve or benefit, average workshop attendance, improved performance on tests, etc.).  Objective 1 Increased placement of Program Participants in employment, internship, or business ownership opportunities.Projected goal for objective 1 At least 75% of the participants from our program will secure investment, acceptance into a follow-on incubator or grants program (i.e. NYC Boss Up), or secure a job or paid internship during the completion of our program.Objective 2 Number of mentorship relationships developed through corporate and community partnersProjected goal for objective 2  Each participant experiences at least two unique mentoring and coaching experiences with a mentor or corporate volunteer?Will you have corporate volunteer opportunities available for this proposed program/project? o	Yes  The Cambio Coaches ProgramStudies show that personal mentorship and coaching has immense benefits for learners and their ability to process information and complete projects. Even in our digital world, learners often need an expert coach or mentor to contextualize learning, to differentiate it, and to offer their experience to help them succeed. We created the Cambio Coaches program not only to help our participants better develop their social ventures, but to also create opportunities for professional exchange, to receive and interpret feedback, and to develop social capital with professionals that could lead to future internship and job opportunities.  For our entrepreneurs, seeing mentors from their own community is especially impactful, and we encourage coaches of color to apply and would welcome introductions to coaches who may be interested.Perks & Rewards Program Contributors on our PlatformStudents in our programs receive access to our Journey platform - a gamified learning platform where students can earn points for completing lessons and challenges - which can be cashed in for exciting perks and rewards! Are you interested in packaging your know-how, services, or products as a reward to incentivize student entrepreneurs to complete their next milestone? This can look like contributing access to a software program or publication, providing a training session in a corporate volunteer’s area of expertise, offering resume writing office hours, or in-kind goods like hardware for students participation in the program or the ventures they create.Paid Internships to Cambio StudentsThe benefits of work-based learning; the lack of access to employment opportunities for under-resourced youth, especially in the design, technology, investment, and startup industries. Help diversify innovation industries, and become part of a pipeline to empower underemployed youth from our pool of qualified Cambio alumni.Whether you are a startup or mature organization, we are looking for a variety of employment opportunities across a range of sectors. All experiences are valuable for our students, and the Cambio Labs team will work to ensure the best fit for organizations and students by assessing preferences and qualifications through program results, surveys, and interviews. Introductions, interviews, and approval of employer partners are a prerequisite before job placement.What are the corporate volunteer opportunities that may be available for this program or project?Employee Engagement ProgramsIntegrating Financial Literacy or Business Skill Development Programming into our platformIn this collaboration, a corporate partner will share its curriculum in financial literacy with a digital educational platform that supports underserved social entrepreneurs. The educational platform will provide access to this curriculum for entrepreneurs who may not have had access to high-quality financial education resources previously.This collaboration aims to make financial education more accessible to underserved communities and provide the tools and knowledge needed to start and grow successful ventures. Corporate partners can contribute to this effort by sharing their financial skills and expertise in a way that supports social entrepreneurship and economic development.For example, banking partners may find this collaboration particularly beneficial for the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which requires banks to provide investment and lending services to low- and moderate-income communities. By sharing their financial literacy curriculum with the digital educational platform, banking partners can help fulfill their CRA requirements and support the development of underserved communities.Overall, this collaboration is a win-win situation for both the corporate partner and the social entrepreneurship community. Corporate partners can contribute to the development of underserved communities while promoting their financial skills and expertise, and social entrepreneurs can access valuable resources to help them succeed in their ventures.Speed Coaching EventsWe are looking for corporate partners who are interested in designing speed coaching events for social entrepreneurship participants. These events will provide entrepreneurs with half-day experiences to immerse them in the corporate partner's services, products, and work culture.Corporate partners (and our entrepreneurs) will have the opportunity to showcase their expertise and introduce entrepreneurs to their field. They can provide coaching sessions in areas where they have particular expertise and offer insights and advice to the entrepreneurs.In addition to focusing on their areas of expertise, we encourage corporate partners to consider offering coaching sessions in fields that the entrepreneurs may not have been exposed to. This will help entrepreneurs broaden their understanding of the business world and potentially discover new areas of interest.Overall, a speed coaching event provides a unique opportunity for corporate partners to share their knowledge and experience with social entrepreneurship programs. It's a chance for entrepreneurs to gain valuable insights and advice while also learning about new fields.How often could volunteers engage in the proposed program or project (e.g., daily, weekly, bi-monthly)?Bi-weeklyHow many volunteers would you need per day/session of the proposed program or project?We would love to have a coordinator to support pairing participants with mentors, speakers, and experts on our platform and to engage folks in the WSCF network.
