Our mission is to design and deliver transformative 12-week business incubators, technology, and partnerships that equip participants with the skills and networks to become founders of organizations driven by social and environmental missions.Since 2021, we have empowered over 480 BIPOC rising social entrepreneurs through innovative workforce development initiatives. We have successfully launched 32 incubator programs, with over 80% of participants under the age of 24. These programs are designed not only to foster entrepreneurial skills but also to create pathways to meaningful careers and economic mobility.Our commitment to creating sustainable career pathways is demonstrated through our strategic partnerships, including with Work Progress Program (WPP) worksites. At Comp Sci High and in collaboration with the Children’s Arts and Science Workshop (CASW), we provided tailored workforce development opportunities to over 40 youth. These partnerships allowed us to integrate real-world work experiences with our educational programs, ensuring that participants not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also develop practical, marketable skills.Moreover, our partnerships with community-based organizations such as the RETI Center, Good Shepherd Services, First Tech Fund, Blackstone Launchpad, CUNY’s Internship to Employment (i2e) program, Grant Associates’ Industry Scholars Program, and the Brooklyn STEAM Center have allowed us to deliver specialized training in social entrepreneurship, green business practices,communications, data analysis, and solar installation. These programs are specifically tailored for youth aged 18-24 and incorporate subsidized work experiences that bridge the gap between education and employment.Cambio Labs has yet to apply for or receive public funding and is fully funded through program revenue (84%) and grants (16%).As an intern supervisor, Sarah Zou exemplifies leadership and mentorship, drawing on her extensive experience in product strategy and technical management.

Target demographics (e.g., age, income level, general education level and skills, barriers, etc.). ? List target recruitment neighborhoods or indicate if the program recruits citywide.? Explain how you will assist youth ages 16-17 in obtaining working papers (if applicable). ? Describe how you propose to target youth living in NYCHA residences and target number of participants to be recruited from each NYCHA development (if applicable). Cambio Labs is dedicated to empowering NYCHA residents aged 18-24, a group rich in potential and resilience.

Despite living in low-income households, with average annual incomes around $18,000 to $20,000, they possess a unique blend of lived experience and community insight that positions them as valuable contributors to their neighborhoods and beyond.Educationally, while many in this demographic may not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education (74%), they demonstrate a keen desire for learning and skill development, and specifically starting their own businesses. Their experiences have fostered adaptability and resourcefulness, qualities that are essential in today’s dynamic workforce.Overall, NYCHA manages 335 public housing developments across New York City's five boroughs.  Cambio Labs launched a pilot program, StartUP NYCHA, with 23 entrepreneurs from all boroughs at Fulton Houses.  We aim to launch our second cohort of our program in Queens, and accept all NYCHA residents aged 18-24.Like our first program, we would expand our relationships with tenement associations, cohost design workshops, and table at Family Days at NYCHA.3.

These positions are designed to immerse participants in the process of developing and scaling social enterprises with a strong focus on sustainability and community impact.Proposed Work Experience Types and RolesThe Social Entrepreneurship Interns would be involved in all stages of incubating social enterprises within Cambio Labs. Their responsibilities would include conducting market research, assisting in the development of business plans, and supporting the execution of community-focused initiatives. They would work closely with Cambio Labs’ leadership to design and implement projects that address pressing social issues, particularly those impacting BIPOC communities.The Green Entrepreneurship Interns would focus on sustainability initiatives, such as assisting with the development and promotion of green businesses, in particular in the renewable energy sector. Their roles would involve researching sustainable practices, supporting the implementation of eco-friendly business models, and participating in projects like solar installation and environmental awareness campaigns. One participant would be a co-facilitator and instructor in training, who will learn how to host social entrepreneurship incubators.Matching Participants with OpportunitiesParticipants would be matched with these roles based on their interests, strengths, and career goals, determined through an initial assessment and interview process. This tailored approach ensures that each intern is placed in a role that aligns with their passions and maximizes their potential impact.Participant Supervision and Project SupervisorsParticipants would be supervised by experienced staff members. Sarah Zou, Director of Tech and Product, would oversee the Social Entrepreneurship Interns, ensuring they gain hands-on experience in developing technology-driven solutions for social challenges. Michelle Maluwetig, Director of Operations & Strategic Partnerships, would supervise the Green Entrepreneurship Interns, guiding them in implementing sustainable business practices and community initiatives.Training, Skills Development, and Community BenefitsInterns would receive comprehensive training in entrepreneurship, sustainability, and project management. They would develop essential skills such as business planning, market analysis, and stakeholder engagement. These work experiences not only equip participants with the tools to succeed in their future careers but also benefit the community by fostering enterprises that address social and environmental issues within underserved neighborhoods.Work Environment, Safety, and COVID-19 ProtocolsCambio Labs is committed to providing a safe and supportive work environment. Interns would work in well-equipped, socially distanced spaces, with strict adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols, including regular sanitization and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). Remote work options would also be available where appropriate.Ensuring Completion of Work AssignmentsTo ensure that participants complete their work assignments, Cambio Labs would implement a structured schedule, regular check-ins, and clearly defined milestones. Supervisors would provide continuous feedback and support, ensuring that each intern stays on track and successfully completes their projects.Funding ModelCambio Labs would adopt a stipend-based funding model to provide financial support while fostering responsibility and commitment. This approach aligns with our goals by offering tangible incentives for participants to engage fully, ensuring both their personal growth and the success of their work experiences.4.

Each participant will work 20 hours per week, fully immersed in their roles as Social or Green Entrepreneurship Interns. These roles are integral to the broader Startup NYCHA Business Accelerator Program, which is designed to help NYCHA entrepreneurs launch and develop their own businesses.Training and Support ServicesOver the course of 12 weeks, participants in the Cambio Labs Social Entrepreneurship Program will be guided through a structured journey of entrepreneurial development. The program begins with an introduction to entrepreneurship and innovation, followed by problem analysis and customer profiling. Students will then conduct market research, engage in design thinking, and participate in community outreach to prepare for empathy interviews. As they progress, they will ideate solutions, conduct competitive analysis, and develop business models. The program includes breaks to allow for reflection and catch-up, before diving into MVP (Minimum Viable Product) creation, testing, and validation. The final weeks focus on financial analysis, fundraising, communication tools, and intense pitch preparation, culminating in a final pitch event where students present their business ideas to a panel of judges. Throughout, participants receive mentorship, engage in hands-on activities, and apply lean startup principles to build and refine their ventures.Mentorship and SupportMentorship is a key component of the Startup NYCHA program. The Journey Platform will also facilitate this mentorship, enabling mentors to monitor progress and provide timely advice that pertains to their ventures’ success and development.To support participants experiencing hardships, Cambio Labs has established partnerships with several community-based partnerships and supervisors to ensure that participants have access to necessary resources, including mental health support, emergency financial assistance, and educational tools. These wrap-around services are essential in helping participants stay focused and succeed in the program.Transitioning After the Work ExperienceUpon completing the 12-week work experience, participants will be well-prepared to transition to further education, training, or employment opportunities. Each participant will receive individualized career counseling to help identify and pursue their next steps, whether that be continuing their entrepreneurial journey, seeking employment, or furthering their education. The skills and experiences gained during the program, combined with the resources and networks developed, will position participants to achieve long-term success.In summary, Cambio Labs’ Startup NYCHA program provides a comprehensive, supportive environment where participants can develop their entrepreneurial skills, build viable businesses, and make meaningful contributions to their communities. Through hands-on experience, mentoring, and the innovative Journey Platform, participants will be equipped with the tools and knowledge necessary to succeed as social entrepreneurs and community leaders.5.
