After witnessing firsthand the lack of access to entrepreneurial education and mentorship for BIPOC youth while working as an educator, Sebastián was inspired to take action. His experiences as a first-generation child of immigrant entrepreneurs and his passion for social justice led him to create Cambio Labs—a nonprofit dedicated to empowering underestimated and underrepresented communities.Our mission is to bridge the opportunity gap faced by low-income BIPOC youth and adults by equipping them with the tools to create generational wealth and drive meaningful change. Through culturally relevant, project-based learning and social innovation, we prepare participants to become leaders and social entrepreneurs who are capable of solving the challenges their communities face.Since our inception, we have developed and delivered transformative programs and technology, such as our digital learning platform "Journey" and green and entrepreneurial workforce development initiatives. Through user-centered design and continuous collaboration with the communities we serve, we've supported over 500 participants to date, helping them develop critical skills in innovation, leadership, and problem-solving.At the heart of our work is the belief that those closest to social and environmental challenges are best positioned to solve them. By co-designing our programs with community members and emphasizing real-world applications, we empower participants to build their own businesses and social ventures to become the next generation of changemakers. Together, we are working to dismantle barriers and create pathways to economic, social, and climate equity.7. What are your current programs/activities? 	?

In other words, how did it come to know this community specifically, and why will you be trusted to play a leading or important role on the proposed project? Cambio Labs works actively in the South Bronx community - delivering school programs to schools like Comp Sci HIgh and the Lab School of Finance and Technology, and serving underrepresented entrepreneurs through business accelerators like Oyate’s Community Capital and the Communitas America Ventures program. Our work in public housing deepened through the launch of Startup NYCHA, a business accelerator program designed specifically for NYCHA residents. This program emerged from extensive community engagement, including workshops, listening sessions, and direct collaboration with NYCHA residents and leaders. For instance, at Fulton Houses, we worked closely with the Tenement Association to co-design a program that fit the schedules and specific needs of residents and recruited participants to participate in the design process at several Family Day events.  Through the launch of Startup NYCHA, we have formed a relationship with Deborah Aviles, Tenement Association President of Mott Haven Houses, who is supportive of launching the Cambio Solar pilot at Mott Haven’s Community Center.Our connection to economically disadvantaged and climate impacted communities in NYC has been established since 2021 through a collaboration with the RETI Center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where we partnered for two years to digitize and deliver a solar workforce and green entrepreneurship curriculum for 5 cohorts made up of underemployed adults. Together, we delivered a green entrepreneurship curriculum that trained 94 participants, primarily NYCHA residents, to become solar entrepreneurs and attain workforce certifications like OSHA and GPRO. We also helped place solar graduate interns into paid internship opportunities.All of these past experiences, community relationships, and participatory program design philosophies will be instrumental to the launch and success of the proposed Cambio Solar program at Mott Haven Houses in 2025.  Is the Organization comprised of or run by: select all that apply: Employees (salaried or stipend)Members(fees or due paying)Volunteers(unpaid) Does the Organization have paid (salaried or stipend) development/fundraising support? yesWhat was your Organization's total budget in 2023?

Focus on the population(s) and location(s) who will be impacted by this project. Include information for your community that you deem relevant such as an overview of the characteristics of the population, income level, housing status, health status, educational attainment, citizenship status, etc.	Demographics of NYCHA in the BronxAt Cambio Labs, we are acutely aware of the formidable challenges faced by the working-age residents of South Bronx public housing, a community predominantly composed of low-income Black and Latinx individuals. In the South Bronx, home to some of the poorest Congressional districts in the nation, public housing residents endure widespread economic hardship, with average annual incomes hovering around $27,000?. The South Bronx’s public housing population faces disproportionately high unemployment rates.The challenges for South Bronx residents go beyond employment. Educational attainment levels are generally lower, with fewer residents holding higher education credentials. This lack of formal qualifications limits access to traditional career pathways, which contributes to persistent underemployment. Health concerns also play a significant role: chronic illnesses such as asthma are more prevalent in the South Bronx due to poor living conditions and disproportionate exposure to environmental pollutants. These factors collectively restrict many residents' ability to access steady, well-paying jobs or even consider starting their own businesses.Despite these barriers, the entrepreneurial potential within South Bronx public housing remains untapped. Less than 1% of NYCHA residents in the area report income from business activities?, and systemic challenges such as limited access to capital, formal business training, and networks further stifle entrepreneurial ambitions. While some city initiatives offer business support, they often fail to reach a significant portion of the population, and many aspiring entrepreneurs operate informal businesses without access to essential resources.The green economy, particularly the solar industry, presents a unique opportunity for South Bronx residents to achieve economic mobility. Solar installation jobs offer an average salary of $50,920 annually and typically do not require a college degree?. In addition, 89% of solar firms report difficulties finding qualified applicants, especially in installation roles?. This presents a significant opportunity for South Bronx public housing residents to access jobs in a growing industry that also offers paths to career advancement.Through the proposed pilot of the Cambio Solar program in 2025, we will serve up to 30 underemployed adult participants that are residents of Mott Haven Houses. These participants will join our programming to acquire professional certifications, green entrepreneurial training, and job opportunities in the solar and clean energy sectors. Please describe the project using the below prompts - be sure to include answers to all three questions. Be specific and try to avoid jargon. We need to clearly understand what you intend to accomplish with a grant from World Connect. 1) Briefly describe the project Cambio Solar is a solar workforce training program, green entrepreneurship accelerator, and future cooperative solar installer on a mission to create access to clean energy jobs, utilities savings through community solar projects, and green cooperative and businesses ownership for NYC’s most economically and environmentally vulnerable community members. Our proposal is to launch the pilot program of Cambio Solar from Fall 2024 - Fall 2025 at Mott Haven Houses in the South Bronx, where the NYCHA Community Center will be activated on a weekly basis to deliver the Cambio Solar Program over 9 months - delivering solar and green entrepreneurship training, followed by subsequent paid internship and clean energy job placement.  2) Describe the major activities that will take place Weekly Solar Training Sessions: Delivered at Mott Haven Houses Community Center over a 9-month period, covering topics like solar installation, green jobs training, and vocational training. Participants will gain industry-recognized certifications (OSHA and GPRO) and skills to prepare for clean energy jobs.Green Entrepreneurship Accelerator: Training will also focus on developing green businesses, particularly cooperatives, that can develop business models around solar and clean energy. Participants will have the opportunity to form and join solar cooperatives that can install projects on commercial buildings, residential buildings, and NYCHA rooftops. Through this program, participants will learn how to develop, test, and present the green business models they create which can create economic opportunities, green jobs, and environmental impact in their community. Program participants will also be around developing and managing community solar projects that can reduce utility bills for families in the local community. Paid Internships & Job Placement: Graduates of the program will be connected to paid internships and job opportunities within the clean energy sector. Community Engagement & Iterative Program Development: NYCHA residents, leadership, and community members will be actively involved in designing the program, and providing feedback to ensure it reflects their needs. 3) Explain what the grant funding will be spent onThe grant  from World Connect will be used to develop and deliver a solar training program for NYCHA residents. This includes creating a tailored curriculum that teaches participants about solar energy, installation, and green business skills. Part of the funding will cover the purchase of essential equipment, like solar panels and tools for hands-on learning. Additionally, the grant will fund certifications for participants, such as the OSHA 40 training and GPRO. The grant will also support the salaries of the program instructors, who will lead the training and provide essential guidance. Finally, some of the funding will go towards purchasing laptops for participants to ensure they have access to digital learning materials, and basic supplies needed for the classroom.4. Who was involved in determining this project as a priority by the community? What community engagement strategies were used to determine this project as a priority by the community?	The Cambio Solar project was identified as a priority through a collaborative effort involving NYCHA residents, local leaders, community organizations, and participants from previous successful programs like Startup NYCHA, and our Red Hook Solar Training Program.Key stakeholders included:1. NYCHA Residents and Local Leaders: Residents of Mott Haven Houses and other NYCHA developments were instrumental. The board and presidents of the Mott Haven Houses Tenement Association played significant roles in facilitating introductions and endorsing the project. Their support helped build trust and ensured alignment with community needs.2. Participants of Startup NYCHA and Solar Training Programs in Red Hook: The entrepreneurs who participated in Startup NYCHA provided valuable insights into the community's aspirations for economic empowerment and interest in green industries. Being a program partner in delivering 5 solar training programs in Brooklyn since 2021 has also helped inform and improve our Cambio Solar’s curriculum, as we incorporated feedback from program solar training participants and clean energy employers about developing an effective solar training program.3. Community Organizations: Partnerships with Bronx-based schools and nonprofits such as Comp Sci High, the Lab School of Finance and Technology, the Children's Arts & Science Workshops, and the Oyate Group contributed to understanding the broader challenges and needs of the community.Community Engagement Strategies Used:? Participatory Design Workshops: We conducted co-design workshops with NYCHA residents to tailor the Cambio Solar program to their specific needs. These workshops allowed residents to contribute directly to the program's structure, ensuring it fit their schedules and addressed their priorities. We recruited people to join workshops during NYCHA Family Days - signing people up at our pop up tables.? Listening Sessions and Surveys: Through listening sessions and surveys during our Solar Training Program Red Hook, residents expressed interest in clean energy jobs, community-owned businesses, and the need for sustainable employment. This feedback was crucial in shaping the focus of Cambio Solar.? Pilot Programs and Feedback Loops: The success of Startup NYCHA served as a foundation for determining community priorities. In the pilot at Fulton Houses, over 60 residents signed up, with 30 entrepreneurs selected for the first cohort—95% of whom were women of color. The strong engagement highlighted the community's enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and green workforce programs. ? Direct Collaboration with Tenement Associations: Mott Haven’s tenement president Deborah Aviles has been a key partner and endorsed our project.  Similarly in Fulton Houses, our partnership with Miguel Acevedo, their tenement president facilitated resident participation and support of local government leaders and agencies. Their involvement was critical in mobilizing resources and ensuring the program's relevance. Sebastián has presented regularly at TA meetings, and has had meetings with TA leadership to design programs.5. What will be the impact of this project on the community?  Focus your answer more on the big picture, what will it change in the community for those directly impacted by this project? Cambio Solar has the potential to create transformative, long-lasting changes for NYCHA residents and specifically at Mott Haven Houses in the South Bronx. By focusing on renewable energy, workforce development, and cooperative ownership, the program will not only economically empower individuals, but also lead to a strengthening of NYCHA community infrastructure and energy independence, and affordable energy sources for housing residents.The big picture impact:Economic Empowerment and Job Creation: At its core, Cambio Solar will provide participants with the skills and certifications needed to access high-demand jobs in the clean energy sector. This is especially critical for communities like NYCHA, where unemployment rates are high, and opportunities for stable, well-paying jobs are limited. By equipping residents with industry-recognized certifications, such as in solar installation, the program will open doors to jobs that offer financial security and upward mobility, leading to increased household incomes and reduced economic disparities.Pathways to Ownership and Wealth Building: A unique element of Cambio Solar is its focus on green entrepreneurship and cooperative business ownership. Participants will not only learn how to install solar panels but will also be empowered to create and own cooperative solar installation businesses and become owners of clean energy businesses. This model fosters local wealth creation by giving community members ownership of the very businesses that provide essential services. Over time, this could shift the economic landscape of the community, creating a local economy that is community-owned and self-sustaining.Environmental Sustainability and Energy Access: As Cambio Solar trains participants to develop community solar projects, it will directly contribute to increasing access to clean, renewable energy within the community. This can lead to lower energy costs for residents, making clean energy more accessible and affordable, particularly for low-income households. Reduction of Social Inequities: By providing access to green jobs and cooperative ownership opportunities, Cambio Solar directly addresses systemic inequities that have historically marginalized low-income, BIPOC communities. These opportunities will allow communities to benefit from economic growth in high-demand sectors by lowering barriers to entry. Furthermore, through our platform, we deliver skills and training that will help close the gap in technical and digital competencies, including but not limited to leveraging AI, basic digital marketing skills, and no-code web design.Pollution and Climate mitigation: by providing access to clean energy through solar, and lessening the community’s reliance on fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gasses, Cambio Solar can improve the air quality and health standards in some of NYC’s most polluted areas of the Bronx. We work to actively mitigate environmental racism through the systemic pollution of low income areas. We will also do our part to help NYC meet its urgently needed carbon-reduction goals to transition to a zero-carbon future by 2030.6. Describe who will benefit from the successful implementation of this project.  Please include an estimated number of direct and indirect beneficiaries.  (Direct beneficiaries are individuals who experience benefits which can be directly attributed to the project. Indirect beneficiaries are individuals whose benefits can be attributed to a direct beneficiary.)If this project includes training or an opportunity that is limited to a certain number of people, please describe your selection process and estimate how many people you expect will apply and how many people you expect to accept. Direct Beneficiaries:NYCHA Residents: The primary direct beneficiaries will be approximately 30 residents of NYCHA housing in the South Bronx, specifically from Mott Haven Houses, who will participate in the solar workforce training program. These individuals will receive hands-on training in solar installation, green entrepreneurship, and cooperative business management. They will also gain industry-recognized certifications (e.g., OSHA, solar installation certifications), and participate in internships or job placements within the renewable energy sector.Participants of the Cooperative Ownership Model: trainees will have the opportunity to participate in forming a cooperative solar installation business. These individuals will directly benefit from ownership and wealth-building opportunities, creating long-term financial stability through collective business profits and community-led solar projects.Local Business and Employment Networks: Local businesses involved in the renewable energy supply chain—such as suppliers, contractors, and service providers—will also be direct beneficiaries. They will see increased demand for their services as more community solar projects are launched, fostering local economic growth.Indirect Beneficiaries:Families of Participants: The families of the direct beneficiaries, estimated to be around 120 individuals, will benefit indirectly through the improved economic conditions of participants. Broader NYCHA and South Bronx Communities: As community solar projects are established, approximately 500 additional NYCHA residents and community members will indirectly benefit as more solar units are installed locally, resulting in lower utility bills, improved energy access, and greater community ownership of local energy resources that will result in both economic and environmental benefits for these residents.Environmental Impact: As solar installations reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the entire neighborhood will experience indirect benefits in terms of improved air quality and reduced carbon emissions, contributing to better public health.Selection Process:Given the high demand for workforce development programs, we anticipate receiving 90-120 applications for the 30 available spots in the Cambio Solar program. The selection process will prioritize:? NYCHA residents from the Mott Haven Houses and surrounding public housing communities.? Individuals who are economically disadvantaged or unemployed.? Those with a demonstrated interest in renewable energy or green entrepreneurship.We will use a participatory selection process in collaboration with local community leaders, the tenement association, and nonprofit partners to ensure that the most underserved and motivated individuals are selected. Estimated Beneficiaries:Direct beneficiaries: 30 individuals (trainees) + 10 cooperative members = 40 direct beneficiaries.Indirect beneficiaries: 120 family members + 500 broader community members = 620 indirect beneficiaries.In total, the project is expected to impact 660 individuals directly and indirectly through training, employment, cooperative ownership, and expanded community solar access.7.
