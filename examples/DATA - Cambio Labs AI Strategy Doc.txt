About NGOCambio Labs is a nonprofit dedicated to empowering underestimated and under-resourced communities—primarily low-income youth and adults through entrepreneurial education, workforce training,and access to technology.A key component of Cambio Lab’s strategy is the development and roll out of the Journey platform, their signature digital learning platform that engages participants in dynamic learning through multimedia content, project-based challenges, AI-assistance, and gamification. As users earn Gemstones on our platform, they can cash in on valuable Prizes like workshops, mentorship opportunities, and other professional services. The Journey platform is customizable for other educational organizations and instructors to digitize and gamify their own curricular content to run educational programs and training.Cambio Labs has delivered a variety of Cambio Courses using the Journey platform, including their flagship Social Entrepreneurship Incubator, Cambo Coding & AI, Green Workforce Development, and Startup NYCHA.They have delivered their educational programs and platform in New York City and San Francisco in the USA, and across India.Technology FoundationCambio Labs’ Journey platform is hosted on AWS and built with React and TypeScript. An overview of our tech stack is here. The journey platform is composed of Two Single Page Applications (SPAs), a content management interface for educators and administrators and a student-facing learning platform with interactive content. Supporting these applications is an AWS S3 Bucket that handles object storage for static assets like videos, images, and PDFs, providing fast content delivery and virtually unlimited storage capacity. As different features of the SPAs are used, our system’s dataflow follows a structured pattern of interactions. Specifically, AWS EC2 Instances serve as virtual servers running the core application logic and API endpoints that power the platform's functionality. A PostgreSQL Database stores all persistent data including user profiles, progress tracking information, content metadata, gamification metrics such as Gemstones, and transactional data. The backend services run on Node.js with Docker containerization, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.We then utilize the data from the PostgreSQL Database to develop user-facing analytics and AI tools.Our technology staff includes:?

The data that pertains to implementation of our Sparky AI bot, hosted via OpenAI LLM API, can be broken down into:? Student-Specific Data Management: As students progress through Journey courses, their responses, submissions, and interaction patterns are systematically collected and organized into individual user directories. Each directory functions as a comprehensive digital portfolio containing all materials from a specific student's learning journey. When students log into the platform, the system retrieves their personalized data repository, enabling the AI assistant Sparky to access relevant learning artifacts and develop a nuanced understanding of each student's learning style, strengths, and areas for improvement. This personalized data foundation is further enriched by instructor feedback and assessments, creating a dynamic profile that allows Sparky to reference specific documents and interactions that characterize each student's unique educational experience.? Course-Level Data Architecture: When educators and administrators develop courses on the Journey platform, the system automatically generates course-specific directories containing all related materials, resources, and content. This organizational structure enables Sparky to receive specialized training tailored to each course's unique requirements and learning objectives. The platform leverages LangChain technology to enhance this process by wrapping course materials with semantic descriptions that serve as contextual metadata. When students ask course-specific questions, Sparky utilizes these semantic markers to identify the most relevant materials and deliver targeted, contextually appropriate responses that align with the course's educational goals.? Platform-Wide Intelligence Development: As the Journey platform expands to host an increasing number of courses across diverse subjects and learning contexts, Sparky's capabilities evolve to recognize broader patterns in user behavior and learning preferences. The AI system is designed to develop sophisticated user categorization abilities, similar to comprehensive personality assessments, that enable it to understand individual communication styles, motivational triggers, and learning preferences. This platform-wide intelligence allows Sparky to adapt its response patterns, language choices, and interaction tone to create highly personalized educational experiences that resonate with each user's unique characteristics and learning approach.Program OutcomesWe believe that the creation and implementation of Sparky will improve our platform and impact potential in the following areas:? Enable personalized learning for learners that use the Journey platform ? Enable auto-assessment and auto-certifications? Enable greater use of the course creation capabilities of our platform, automated coaching and assistance for instructors in content and lesson creations, and standardizing content delivery for instructors? Enable more self-paced and asynchronous learning by entrepreneurs, allowing for Cambio Labs to increase its scale and impactHow will success be measured?? Conducting a summer 2025 experiment and testing of Sparky, and measuring its effectiveness through student user surveys? Success metric: 75%+ satisfaction with Journey and positive reception and recommendation to others? Skills-Tracking success?
