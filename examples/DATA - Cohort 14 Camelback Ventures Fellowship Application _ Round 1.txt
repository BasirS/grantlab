What issue or opportunity does your venture, product, or service intend to address? Suggested word count: 200 WordsGuidance: Tell us the unmet need for a significant issue that your product or service is filling. We expect you to include evidence for this problem, whether that is supported by quantitative (e.g. numerical data or research) and/or qualitative (e.g. testimonials or lived experience) assessments.

Despite their potential, these communities face systemic barriers, with fewer than 2% of venture-backed startups led by BIPOC entrepreneurs and under 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce coming from BIPOC backgrounds?. Additionally, the digital divide disproportionately affects these populations, limiting access to high-growth sectors that require digital skills, with over 90% of U.S. jobs demanding such skills?.Cambio Labs addresses the urgent need for entrepreneurship, digital literacy, and economic mobility among low-income BIPOC youth and adults. Since our launch in New York City in 2021, we have collaborated with schools in the South Bronx and Brooklyn to reach local underestimated youth, and with local nonprofits and workforce development organizations to reach underemployed adults, many of whom live in public housing (NYCHA). Despite their massive untapped potential, low income BIPOC students, workers, and innovators face systemic barriers, with fewer than 2% of venture-backed startups led by BIPOC entrepreneurs and under 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce coming from BIPOC backgrounds?. Additionally, the digital divide disproportionately affects these populations, limiting access to high-growth sectors that require digital skills, with over 90% of U.S. jobs demanding such skills?.Through our co-designed programs like Startup NYCHA, our Social Entrepreneurship Incubator, Cambio Coding, and our green workforce development,we provide entrepreneurship training, digital literacy education, and mentorship to create access to higher incomes in the tech and green sector. These initiatives are tailored to meet the specific needs of the community, developed through ongoing feedback and partnerships with local organizations.Our work empowers participants with 21st-century skills, preparing them to become entrepreneurs and innovators in a technology-driven economy. By addressing both the economic and digital gaps, Cambio Labs is creating a pathway for long-term financial stability and community wealth creation??.2. What are your venture’s key activities and outcomes that address the need you are solving?  How have you improved your product or service to meet these needs?  Suggested word count: 300 WordsGuidance: In the simplest terms, tell us what is your venture’s primary product or service. We believe that the best ideas are designed alongside your customers and beneficiaries, and we encourage you to include evidence of co-creation with the communities you serve. In your response, we expect a clear outline of how you have adapted to feedback from the community in order to improve your venture offerings. It might also include your definition of success in these key activities and outcomes as well as how you’ll evaluate when success is achieved. 280 wordsCambio Labs empowers low income BIPOC social entrepreneurs and workers through educational programs, learning technology, and by providing access to investment and job opportunities.In our curricular and tech design, we follow an iterative process where we invite and integrate the feedback of our community members, who we center as experts. Our approach is based on user-centered design, where we test our assumptions about community needs and engage in two-way dialogues to cultivate empathy before we design. As an example, our first platform was coded by high schoolers for high schoolers, and piloted at Comp Sci High, in the Bronx. Similarly, StartUp NYCHA was designed after several tenement association meetings, Family Day recruitment, and two co-designing workshops with residents to customize the curriculum and the platform to their needs and vision for entrepreneurship.  Throughout the program and in partnership with schools and other partner organizations, participants are surveyed to measure entrepreneurial mindset development, network expansion, and tangible skill development.To measure our success, we track several key outcomes: business launches, employment placements, skill acquisition, and economic impact within the communities we serve. Our programs are designed not only to foster individual success but also to generate community-wide impact by empowering residents to create wealth and job opportunities. In the future, we aspire to measure deeper community impact by tracking the number of businesses that sustain beyond one year, the increase in household income among participants, and shifts in the local economy due to resident-owned businesses and renewable, affordable energy through green workforce development programs. We also plan to use data from our Journey platform to track real-time engagement, skill mastery, and user feedback, allowing for continuous improvement of our offerings??.3. Who are your customers or beneficiaries? How do you acquire or plan to acquire customers or beneficiaries? Please also share information on any pilots run, those involved, and how the results inform the venture.Suggested  word count: 200 WordsGuidance: We are asking this question to generally understand how you have already or are prepared to engage with customers or beneficiaries. This might include a quantitative assessment of the number or proportion of customers in your market. We expect it to include a qualitative description of their characteristics and needs. Your response must also include a summary of pilot activities and results.223Cambio Labs’ business model serves two key groups: our direct customers— Program Partners Organizations —and our core beneficiaries—low-income BIPOC youth and adults that participate in our programs. Our direct customers include Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), schools, and government agencies that license our Journey platform to deliver entrepreneurial and workforce development programs to underserved populations. These organizations rely on our platform to offer culturally competent, scalable, and impactful educational services. Our partnerships with entities like the RETI Center, Brooklyn STEAM Center, and Prep for Prep have allowed us to expand our reach and serve over 600 learners.Our core beneficiaries are primarily low-income BIPOC youth and adults, especially those living in public housing, such as NYCHA developments. These communities face systemic barriers, including limited access to digital infrastructure, quality education, and career pathways. In 2024, we focused on piloting programs like Startup NYCHA and the Social Entrepreneurship Incubator, which directly address these barriers by providing participants with mentorship, digital skills, and access to job opportunities in tech and green sectors??.Historically, we’ve seen our platform and curriculum grow from small, cohort-based programs to a scalable Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model. This shift would allow CBOs to license and customize the platform, enabling them to reach more beneficiaries across different communities.4. What makes your venture profitable and/or financially sustainable? Suggested  word count: 200 WordsGuidance: We want to confirm that your business model will serve your community in the long-term. If applicable, your response will include an overview of your fundraising strategy. Regardless, we expect you to include your plans for increasing your venture’s reach and/or deepening impact in the future. We also expect to see evidence of steps you have taken to ensure your product or service is financially accessible to those that need it most.193Cambio Labs ensures financial sustainability through a diversified revenue model comprising program sales, platform licensing, and strategic partnerships. We aim for a future funding mix of 60% earned revenue and 20% from grants and 20% from discretionary funding from local officials. By 2025, we anticipate our revenue to be composed of 40% from youth programs, 40% from adult programs, and 20% from our Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. To drive growth and enter new markets while keeping programs affordable for low-income BIPOC communities, we are diversifying our offerings beyond social entrepreneurship to include coding, AI, and solar programs.We offer our programs at no cost to participants and often provide stipends through collaborations with workforce development initiatives. This approach enables participants to upskill without financial barriers. Our operations are sustained through diverse paid partnerships and cross-sectoral fundraising strategies that include sales (74% of total revenue to date), corporate sponsorships & grants (26% of total revenue).Looking ahead, we plan to expand our reach by partnering with organizations like National Geographic and public libraries to deliver their curricula to the public through our platform. Self-paced models at community centers and libraries will help us serve more communities.5. Tell us how your background and lived experience inform the evolution of your idea and venture. Suggested  word count: 200 WordsGuidance: We believe solutions are best created by and for the community. It’s important for founders to be proximate to their community and the identities they reflect. Additionally, we look for founders who are resilient to obstacles they face while operating with a growth mindset. You can use this space to share what experiences, qualities, and skills you bring to your venture. We expect you to elaborate on how your identity and proximity to the community continually informs decisions you make for the venture. If you need a pep talk on telling your story, refer to our Ruthless Manifesto.       225 wordsAs a first-generation Latinx educator and entrepreneur, my lived experiences deeply inform the mission and evolution of Cambio Labs. Growing up in an immigrant family from South America, I witnessed firsthand the systemic barriers that marginalized communities face in accessing quality education and economic opportunities. Teaching in low-income school districts exposed me to the stark inequities students endure daily, fueling my commitment to create solutions that bridge these gaps.My journey as a social entrepreneur began in China, where I launched initiatives to address educational disparities. This international experience, coupled with my work in New York City, has honed my resilience and adaptability—qualities essential for overcoming obstacles and fostering a growth mindset. My global perspective drives me to serve migrant and refugee populations in the U.S. and to scale our Journey platform and programs to developing countries worldwide.Recognizing the transformative power of personalized education, I leverage my experience as an instructor and coach to integrate AI technologies that standardize and streamline processes. This approach allows us to scale individualized learning techniques, making them accessible to those who need them most.Being deeply connected to the communities we serve continually informs our decisions at Cambio Labs. Our initiatives, such as Startup NYCHA, empower public housing residents to launch businesses, reflecting our commitment to uplift marginalized voices through solutions created by and for the community.
