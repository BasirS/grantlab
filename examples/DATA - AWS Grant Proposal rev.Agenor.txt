Why now? (200-350 words) Please use 350 words or lessCambio Labs was founded to tackle a dual crisis: exclusion from both education and the economy. Our mission is to create innovative, accessible, and culturally relevant learning pathways into high-growth industries like green energy, technology, and entrepreneurship. While our programs have demonstrated strong impact, we’ve now reached a critical inflection point—demand for our services far exceeds our current capacity, and we need to invest in our platform to make our programming more accessible and responsive.Since launching in 2021, we’ve supported over 600 learners, but our reach is limited by the constraints of direct service delivery. For example, our Startup NYCHA program received triple the number of applications we could accept. Demand continues to grow as schools, workforce agencies, and public infrastructure partners across New York City and beyond request our programming. To meet this need, we must evolve into a digital-first organization capable of delivering scalable, tech-enabled education.Now is the time to fully activate and enhance our Journey platform. By integrating generative AI, real-time analytics, and AWS cloud services, we can shift from a locally delivered model to a national, self-paced learning solution. This expansion is especially urgent for learners navigating barriers like economic hardship, limited internet access, or nontraditional work and family schedules.This project is not only timely - it’s imperative. As the future of work becomes increasingly digital, underserved communities risk being further marginalized without access to responsive, relevant, and tech-enabled education. With this investment, we can seize a transformational opportunity: to scale a proven model, deliver equitable access to career-building education, and create a new national standard for community-driven innovation in workforce development.2.7 What most closely aligns with what this project will enable your organization to do? ?
