Our platform hosts our curricula, which equips founders with the foundations of entrepreneurship, AI and digital literacy.   Full Technology Project Description* How did you assess this need?We are prioritizing this additional tech build to deliver increased impact. By developing a mobile app, we will save on the costs of procuring laptops, allowing participants to complete independent work outside of learning sessions. Participants will be able to advance their business development on their own time. Currently, 41% of our target audience lacks desktop or laptop access, limiting curriculum accessibility. Our platform builds essential digital skills, required for 92% of jobs, yet less than one-third of the workforce possesses these skills. Our curriculum also teaches entrepreneurs to leverage AI for business efficiency and impact.This strategic build aims to expand our reach from 450 to 3,000 participants annually and reduce costs for organizations hiring Cambio Labs to upskill workers and entrepreneurs. A mobile-based app will enable participants to conduct research, build MVPs, and network from anywhere.  Our curriculum supports a hybrid model, with instructors facilitating interactive, collaborative, design thinking activities. Connecting participants with volunteer mentors is crucial for social capital building, as 85% of positions are filled through networking. They will have additional interactive support outside of the classroom in two ways, with (i) Sparky, our AI chatbot, which will introduce and guide students in how to leverage AI and digital tools for their business, and (ii) through volunteer mentors on our platform.How will it be implemented and used?
