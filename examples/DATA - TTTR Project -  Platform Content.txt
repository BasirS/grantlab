Problem statement * 488 / 500Inequitable and outdated education systems worldwide are not preparing young people for a 21st century world or workforce. Underemployed adults struggle to find jobs, generate enough income to feed their families, and receive the training or capital to start their own businesses.We believe that every human deserves access to quality education and economic opportunity, and that universal access to education can only be achieved at scale through the deployment of technology and AI.Solution objectives and milestones * 1998 / 2000Cambio Labs built Journey, a gamified learning platform, to make learning engaging and fun for students, and repeatable and scalable for instructors and administrators. In order to revolutionize the usability and scalability of our Journey platform, our team is now developing and piloting Sparky: an AI bot that can personalize and credentialize learning for students at scale, and that can assist teachers and program administrators with curricular development, instructional coaching, assessment, and reporting. The creation and implementation of Sparky AI will improve the effectiveness of our Journey platform and unlock the following capabilities:- Enable more self-paced and asynchronous learning, allowing for users to learn independently during non-traditional hours and in non-traditional spaces- Enable personalized learning and coaching by pulling from user-generated submission data- Enable easy lesson planning, auto-assessment, skills-tracking, auto-certifications, and auto-reporting - reducing major administrative burdens for overworked teachers-Enable expert and personalized coaching for course creators that want to use Journey to deliver courses in their own communities The goal of this project is to launch the first iteration of Sparky and to test it among our growing, global population of Journey users.Shorter term project goals include:- Technical functionality of Sparky bot- Positive data on satisfaction with Sparky and recommendation to others- Collect qualitative evidence of personalized learner and instructor support- Successful program completion, certification, and income generation across coursesLonger term project goals include:- Recruiting more technical staff to maintain and develop Sparky- Creating a mobile responsive version of Journey and Sparky- Delivering access to Journey and AI to the most remote and marginalized communities- Universal access to education through cross-sectoral collaboration and new tech infrastructure
