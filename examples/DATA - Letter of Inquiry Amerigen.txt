Subject: Letter of Inquiry for Funding Support – Advancing Economic Empowerment and Mental Well-Being through Social Entrepreneurship and Workforce DevelopmentDear Grants Committee,I am writing on behalf of Cambio Labs, a nonprofit dedicated to equipping low-income BIPOC youth and adults with the tools, innovation frameworks, and networks necessary to address the challenges facing their communities while gaining financial independence and long-term stability. Our work is grounded in the belief that those closest to systemic problems are best positioned to solve them, and that entrepreneurship and economic mobility are powerful interventions for fostering mental well-being.Cambio Labs is seeking funding from the Van Ameringen Foundation to support our Startup NYCHA and Cambio Solar initiatives, which empower historically marginalized communities by providing them with entrepreneurial education, workforce training, and cooperative business ownership opportunities. Our programs not only teach participants how to launch social enterprises and enter high-demand industries such as clean energy and technology, but also create pathways to economic stability, mental well-being, and community resilience.The Challenge We AddressSystemic poverty, chronic unemployment, and environmental racism disproportionately impact public housing residents and underserved BIPOC communities in New York City, leading to financial instability, stress, and significant mental health disparities. The Van Ameringen Foundation’s commitment to supporting preventative interventions in mental health deeply aligns with our mission, as we believe that economic empowerment is a critical mental health intervention.Many of the communities we serve are:? Facing high unemployment rates and lack of access to high-quality career pathways.? Struggling with intergenerational poverty and financial precarity, exacerbating mental health stressors.? Living in climate-impacted areas where poor environmental conditions contribute to health and psychological burdens.? Lacking the social capital, networks, and mentorship required to access new economic opportunities.Our Solution: Transformative, Community-Driven Economic and Mental Well-BeingCambio Labs operates with a co-design, community-first approach—where we develop solutions with, not for the communities we serve. Our programs provide a holistic pathway from education to economic security, ensuring that participants not only gain financial independence but also strengthen their confidence, leadership, and mental well-being.1. Startup NYCHA – A six-month entrepreneurship accelerator designed to equip NYCHA residents with business development training, mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to capital. This initiative fosters economic resilience and addresses financial stressors linked to mental health disparities by giving participants the skills and confidence to build sustainable businesses.2. Cambio Solar – A solar workforce training and cooperative business incubator, empowering NYCHA residents to gain green workforce certifications, access paid internships, and launch community-owned solar businesses. This initiative addresses the dual challenge of economic inequity and environmental injustice, while also reducing the stress of financial instability through green entrepreneurship.Through these programs, participants develop marketable skills, access well-paying jobs, and build businesses that uplift their communities. More importantly, they gain agency over their futures, reducing the sense of helplessness and stress associated with systemic poverty.Impact and Alignment with Van Ameringen Foundation PrioritiesSince 2021, Cambio Labs has trained over 600 underrepresented youth and adults, providing them with access to entrepreneurship education, job placement, and community-driven business models. Our data shows that program graduates increase their income, gain industry-recognized certifications, and improve their confidence in navigating the workforce, which has a direct impact on reducing financial anxiety and improving mental well-being.By funding Cambio Labs, the Van Ameringen Foundation would be investing in a proven, community-driven intervention that fosters economic empowerment as a preventative mental health strategy. Our work aligns with the foundation’s commitment to addressing systemic inequities by tackling the economic and social determinants of mental health in vulnerable populations.We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we can partner with the Van Ameringen Foundation to create sustainable, transformative change. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and would be happy to provide additional details upon request.
