Overview: Please tell us how your project went.State your organization's name: Cambio Labs CoState your project name: StartUp NYCHAState at least two things that went well: ? Our outreach events and co-designing workshops brought in residents, tenement association leadership, and led to a customized curriculum that was made by and for the entrepreneurial community at NYCHA? Our pilot launched with a waitlist in terms of signups and has engaged an active community of entrepreneurs.What was a key obstacle or challenge you faced in implementing this project?Our hope is to attract more funding to be able to offer funding for entrepreneurs’ product testing and seed funding for entrepreneurs who win the final business competitionState and briefly explain at least one programmatic strategy or component that was effective.We co-designed with the community and recruited a Program Instructor who is a social entrepreneur, an affordable housing advocate, and who grew up in NYCHA.What is one thing you would do differently or better if you implement this project again?We would build in more volunteer engagement opportunities to support the entrepreneurs earlier on and even invite them to co-designing workshops. How did you do outreach for the project participants as well as partners or volunteers?Before applying to StartUp NYCHA, our team proactively engaged with the local community to gauge interest in our pilot program aimed at supporting entrepreneurs within NYCHA. We began our outreach by participating in Fulton Houses’ Tenement Association meeting several months prior to our application. This early engagement allowed us to connect directly with residents and understand their aspirations and challenges.To further deepen our community ties, we attended four Chelsea-based Family Day events, where our students and interns had the opportunity to speak directly with community members. This hands-on approach was instrumental in gathering 60 signups for our initial co-designing workshop, which was developed in collaboration with the residents to ensure it met their specific needs and expectations.Our commitment to fostering entrepreneurship within NYCHA extended beyond these events. We collaborated with key organizations supporting entrepreneurial initiatives at NYCHA, such as REES and BossUp NYCHA, through various calls and meetings. These partnerships helped amplify our efforts and broaden the program's reach.Following the success of our co-designing workshop, we maintained momentum by keeping in touch with interested participants through emails, texts, and calls. This sustained engagement paid off, allowing us to not only fill our initial cohort but to also establish a waitlist for future cohorts, contingent upon additional funding. Our proactive and inclusive approach to community outreach has laid a strong foundation for the program's ongoing success and expansion across the city.How successful was your outreach plan?We successfully recruited our cohort within 12 hours and had a waitlist of 50+ participants. We had to cap acceptances for the program; this further validated that there is a tremendous untapped source of talent and entrepreneurial interest within NYCHA. We collaborated with REES and Boss Up NYCHA to recruit among their previous applicants, which was a major factor for our speedy recruitment success. What groups did you collaborate with on this project? (For example: other neighborhood associations, schools, elected officials, local media, businesses, community-based organizations).Fulton Houses Tenement AssociationElliott-Chelsea Houses Tenement AssociationHudson GuildREESBoss Up NYCHAData: Please share the numbers associated with the following:Number of project staff (individuals who planned, organized, implemented the project): 5Number of project volunteers: 3Total hours of programming provided to project participants: 142.5Full scope of Startup NYCHA ongoing 5-month pilot program from April - August 2024:Incubator Sessions19Total Instructional Hours47.5Total Teaching Hours (including prep hours)142.5Total unique (unduplicated) participants served: 27Total unique participants served who are Chelsea, Hudson Yards and/or Hell’s Kitchen residents:  7Number of youth participants served (under 20 years of age): 1Number of older adults participants served (age 60+): 3Impact: Tell us about your project impact. What overall impact did this project have on your participants, clients and the community?We see the entrepreneurial spirit of the community energized by access to the latest tools of innovation; their co-creation of a community of solidarity and growth; and their integration into a wider ecosystem of entrepreneurial leaders.  Specifically within the NYCHA entrepreneurship ecosystem, we see this program preparing them to compete at BossUp NYCHA, and we see entrepreneurs developing viable and investable businesses through their engagement in this program.Please restate your project objectives and goals as outlined in the original proposal and describe your progress towards them.Our project is called Startup NYCHA, an initiative to bring social entrepreneurship programs and business development resources to NYCHA complexes across New York City. The objective of our program is to create access to entrepreneurial education and resources so that NYCHA youth and adult residents can launch their own companies, gain access to employment and internship opportunities, and launch community-based projects that can also solve local social and environmental problems.Our proposal was to run our pilot program at Fulton Houses in partnership with Miguel Acevedo and the Tenant Association, and in partnership with Hudson Guild and corporate sponsors and employers. Our proposal was to introduce Cambio Labs’ flagship Social Entrepreneurship Program to NYCHA residents, running an 8-12 week intensive entrepreneurship program where student entrepreneurs will form teams, analyze local social issues, and launch real business ventures that can both generate wealth and address local community needs. To this end, we have: ? Designed a 19-week curriculum with full participation (27 entrepreneurs)? We have recruited a volunteer engagement lead to revamp our mentoring program so that participants can build social capital as they are coached and mentored by professionals in the fields of finance, entrepreneurship, technology, and more? Applied for corporate sponsors to provide seed funding for competition finalists? Contacted local elected officials to make requests for discretionary funds to finance the delivery and expansion of Startup NYCHA? All program participants have access to our Journey platform and alumni community, where they can benefit from entrepreneurial curriculum, resources, career opportunities, and prizes for the rest of their lives.After a successful pilot, our vision is to extend our program opportunities to adults, and to work with the 18+ population of NYCHA to help upskill, employ, and empower underemployed adults. NYCHA residents that live in Section 9 housing can also qualify for federal grants as entrepreneurs, as well as receive preferential contracts for serving and repairing NYCHA.We have piloted our program in Chelsea, and our future goal is to bring entrepreneurship programs and incubator spaces to NYCHA developments all over the city. Through our robust and standardized learning platform, and an interconnected network of community projects and instructors, we want to build the infrastructure for a social  innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurial movement across NYCHA.Share an anecdote that illustrates the impact of your work, including quotes from beneficiaries, if possible.“As an entrepreneur in the Startup NYCHA Business Accelerator Program, the first thing I appreciate are my mentors that teach and guide us every week. Moving past basic business information, the curriculum alone allows you to take a deeper dive in getting to know the soul of your business and its story. Being honored to be part of Cohort 1, there needs to be 1000 more after this.Tiffany Barksdale“Problem well stated is a problem half-solved.” - Charles F. Kettering I will never forget our first class. There, I was honored with the opportunity to experience how it feels to be genuinely cared for by people that do not know. The powerful and heartfelt empathy, compassion, kindness and enthusiasm shared by Sebastián and Yasha burst the room with joy, encouragement, humility, acceptance, respect and most importantly a sense of belonging to a new family. The experience has been transformative for United Juice Bar and Grill and my professional development as a Social Entrepreneur. The constant challenges, mentorship sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities have significantly accelerated my growth. I eager to experience what is in store for us all.Muchas gracias Familia Cambio Labs! Betsy Cespedes“I'm an aspiring entrepreneur in the Startup NYCHA five sessions in thus far. Startup NYCHA  has provided valuable insights and feedback. I have participated  in  various  business  programs but StartUp NYCHA  allows the entrepreneurs the opportunity to apply what they're  learning which is a crucial  component.  This aspect has been extremely  helpful for me.”-Kimberly Tyre“Since joining the NYCHA cohort, I feel that I'm going slow yet so fast in the development of my business idea.
