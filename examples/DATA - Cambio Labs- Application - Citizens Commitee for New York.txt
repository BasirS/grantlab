1. Please provide a brief description of your business. (200-word limit)Cambio Labs was created in 2021 as a response to education inequities that limit the ability of low income youth across New York City to create businesses, advocate for their communities, and find gainful employment. Our mission is to equip these young individuals with marketable skills like public speaking, teamwork, collaboration, and innovation. We achieve this through a curriculum that emphasizes social responsibility and project-based learning. Additionally, our program connects students with trusted mentors in the fields of technology, finance, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. Developed by a team of social entrepreneurs, educators, and youth, and in collaboration with community-based organizations, our program is designed to adapt to the rapidly evolving job market, ensuring our students are prepared to excel in their future careers or social ventures.We create transformative, culturally-competent business programs for youth, which we deliver with the help of a gamified learning management system that we designed, called the Journey platform.  Our curriculum is designed to empower youth to leverage technology to design and launch impactful businesses to solve issues in their communities. 1. We understand that businesses are essential in the fabric of communities. We look for businesses that frame the way they give back to the community they serve. How does your business support the community? In our programs, participants work in teams to design business solutions for issues they care about in their communities.  Through a social innovation incubator, merging design thinking with project-based learning, participants are equipped with 21st century skills to prepare them for an evolving, tech-driven economy. With the support of our digital learning platform, we deliver an immersive experience where participants form teams to tackle societal challenges, fostering skills in empathy, stakeholder analysis, and problem-solving. The curriculum, adaptable in length, emphasizes hands-on community engagement and empathy research, guiding participants in developing sustainable business models for social impact. In preparation for a final pitch before a panel of judges of investors and entrepreneurs, students fine-tune their marketing and sustainability strategies, learn to develop a viable business model, and understand revenue and cost structures. Most importantly, as a team, they acquire critical collaborative skills, develop financial and digital literacy, and learn self-advocacy.  Our platform allows us to meet our learners where they are, provide live feedback, and provide an engaging and gamified learning experience, where they “earn-to-learn” by completing challenges and earning “gemstones” that they can cash in for time with industry leaders and expert mentors to strengthen their ventures in our digital marketplace. We also introduce social innovators in our program how to leverage technology, from developing no-code prototypes, to introducing participants to leveraging artificial intelligence and blockchain in the value-creating process. Cambio Labs aims to close the digital divide that excludes our communities from building intergenerational wealth.1. In no more than 800 words provide a detailed project description. The description should include answers to each of the following questions (approximately 200 words for each): Cambo Labs seeks a grant for the development of a comprehensive, stand-alone Artificial iIntelligence (AI) module designed to enable participants in the Cambio Labs Social Entrepreneurship Program to leverage artificial intelligence for social impact and to support participant learning around our modules on business model development, stakeholder mapping, and empathy research.  The objectives of these courses would be to: (i) provide participants with a foundational understanding of AI principles, mindsets, risks, and applications, (ii) engage students with interactive and practical learning experiences to support their entrepreneurship journey, and (iii) to give participants innovative tools to overcome challenges and enhance creativity.The project unfolds in three phases: development (curriculum design, video production, challenge creation), review and testing (course material review, pilot testing, feedback incorporation), and launch (official integration into the Journey Platform), spanning from J March to May 2024. The budget for this comprehensive course development, including all resources, personnel, and technology requirements, is set at $5,000. A significant portion of the budget would likely be directed towards curriculum design and the production of engaging video content, including hiring subject matter experts and video production teams. This could involve costs related to scripting, filming, editing, and creating interactive elements for the course. Additional funds would be allocated to the development of challenges and learning materials, ensuring that they are both educational and engaging for participants. The review and testing phase, including pilot testing and feedback incorporation, would require resources for participant incentives and technology tools to facilitate feedback collection and analysis. Finally, a part of the budget would support the integration of the course into the Journey Platform, covering technical support and potential platform enhancements to accommodate the new course.This investment is aimed at not only providing students with an in-depth understanding of AI and its applications for social impact, but also at preparing them with the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to innovate and thrive in the digital age.Current education systems fail to adequately teach students evolving digital skills, and even when taught, they are expected to be practiced in off-school settings that require necessary devices and internet connectivity. The Pew Research Center reports that 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, with low-income families and Black and Hispanic households being disproportionately affected. A recent report by the National Skills Coalition shows that in 2023, 92% of jobs across every industry analyzed in the U.S. require digital skills - a number that will continue to grow. Workers who qualify for jobs requiring even one digital skill can earn an average of 23% more than those in jobs with no digital skills. Thus, it’s imperative to equip BIPOC students with the digital literacy and skills required to enter the future job market and elevate their future communities.Low-income communities are particularly in need of digital and financial literacy and skills to enter the future job market—a Pew report recently found that less than 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce are BIPOC and less than 2% of VC funding goes to founders of color. AI is expected to disrupt all industries, but also to deepen inequalities between those with AI literacy, and those without. Already, early evidence has shown that generative AI literacy leads to 30% improvements in productivity. Imagine if this were deployed in the social impact space for diverse, underestimated entrepreneurs in our neighborhoods. Cambio Labs would conduct outreach for the AI course development project by leveraging its established networks and community partners, utilizing digital platforms, and hosting community engagement events. Cambio Labs would organize workshops or informational sessions, either virtually or in person, to provide a deeper understanding of the course content and its benefits for potential participants. Through these activities, Cambio Labs aims to attract participants who are keen on leveraging AI for social good, while also supporting their journey in business model development, stakeholder mapping, and empathy research.  To ensure sustainability, we would strategically incorporate ongoing feedback from our users and diverse partners. This approach allows us to invest in curricular and technological enhancements, ensuring that our participants are equipped with the most innovative tools. Our goal is to prepare them for success in a rapidly changing, technology-driven economy and to enable them to make a meaningful social impact.
