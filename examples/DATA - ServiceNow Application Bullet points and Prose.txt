What is Cambio Labs and how will ServiceNow aid in its goals?Cambio Labs is a nonprofit committed to closing the opportunity gap for underserved BIPOC youth and adults by providing them with tools, innovation frameworks, and supportive networks. Our mission is to help participants develop solutions for pressing community challenges while gaining financial independence. Through entrepreneurial education, workforce development, and technology-driven learning, we enable them to enter high-demand fields such as technology, clean energy, and social entrepreneurship—fostering sustainable futures and systemic transformation.To enhance our operations and long-term impact, we plan to integrate ServiceNow for Nonprofits into our program management, donor engagement, and performance evaluation. This platform’s cloud-based automation and real-time analytics will streamline how we track participant progress across multiple initiatives. By unifying enrollment, certifications, and job placement data, we can accurately measure outcomes for programs like Startup NYCHA, a six-month accelerator for public housing residents; Cambio Solar, a cooperative incubator for the green workforce; Journey Platform, a gamified learning system; Cambio Coding & AI, which teaches software development; and our Social Entrepreneurship Incubator, guiding participants from venture creation to pitch competitions.ServiceNow will strengthen donor and grant management by automating applications, compliance reporting, and real-time impact documentation, thereby reducing administrative burden and improving transparency. It will also optimize volunteer and mentor coordination, making it simpler to schedule sessions and match participants with the right industry professionals. A centralized knowledge base will ensure alumni stay connected and receive ongoing business and career support.By consolidating our data and automating routine tasks, we expect to reduce administrative workloads by around 40%, allowing our team to devote more time to participant engagement and program expansion. We anticipate higher retention rates and more comprehensive tracking of participant outcomes, particularly for alumni who need continued mentorship and assistance. With dynamic dashboards and automated reporting, stakeholders and funders will gain immediate insights into program performance, helping strengthen relationships and increase financial sustainability.Overall, integrating ServiceNow will position Cambio Labs to better support our growing network of learners, mentors, and community partners. By scaling more effectively and delivering personalized, high-quality experiences, we aim to ensure that underrepresented individuals have the resources and opportunities needed to catalyze lasting economic and social change.Cambio Labs is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bridging the opportunity gap for underserved BIPOC youth and adults by equipping them with the tools, innovation frameworks, and networks to solve pressing challenges in their communities while achieving financial independence.
